# 8020case

This is a project to bring an open source PC case to the masses, made of simple 80/20 aluminum extrusions and assembled with no large machines to construct (Mills, Lathes, etc.) I have included a lot of the things you would need to build a fully functioning computer case.  I have plans to add lots of RGB, tempered glass, possibly close up all of the sides, and front panel connections for USB 3 type C and A, audio.  The only tools I can guarantee you will need is a 3D printer, a drill with bits, and hex wrenches.
